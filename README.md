# DouglasvilleZoningSearch

Application made to help staff at the City of Douglasville to verify address jurisdiction and current zoning.
Note: This application is no longer reliable as its source is from the predevelopment data repository. The most up-to-date information is available at https://gis-douglasville.hub.arcgis.com/. I am no longer an employee of CoD and do not have access to the data link required to update this app.
